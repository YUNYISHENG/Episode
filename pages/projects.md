Here is my current projects.

- **Esitmation and Inference: Autoregressive Markov Regime Switching Models for High Dimensional Dataset.**

% Esitmation and Forcasting

% an Application to Date Business Cycles

% (1) employment by sectors; (2) industrial production by markets, with log difference; (3) industrial production by industry with durable goods allowing for sub sectors.

- **Aggregation for State Space Models: Inference Improvement for the Unobservable States.**

% An Application in Autoregressive Markov Regime Models for High Dimensional Dataset to estimating the regimes.

- **Continous Markov Regime Switching Models**

- **Hypothesis Tests and Inferences for Markov Regime Switching Models.**

Restrictions on the Parameters for each Regime and across regimes.
