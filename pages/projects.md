% 
- Aggregation for State Space Models: Inference Improvement for the Unobservable States.
% An Application in Autoregressive Markov Regime Models for High Dimensional Dataset to estimating the regimes.

- Continous Markov Regime Switching Models

- Hypothesis Tests and Inferences for Markov Regime Switching Models.

Restrictions on the Parameters for each Regime and across regimes.
